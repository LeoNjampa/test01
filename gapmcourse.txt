CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT:
Most impt thing u will do as PM.

* Why do so many companies fail? Why are features not successful?
  - focusing on the wrong people
  - they think they know what people want without checking with users
  - we don't test / check our initial thoughts/visions and hypothesis are still valied.

#You are not the customer

# Your CEO / BOSS is NOT the customer

# How do we know if a problem is worth solving.
-Knowing how much someone will pay for it
-market value
-cost for solving the problem

# Finding Your Customers
- Customer Vs User: customer is the person that pays for the product. The user uses the product i.e. the user is the one who faces the problem you are solving.

Try to identify your early adopters - they are way more forgiven! They are enthusiastic and bought into helping you solve your problem.

Activity - Find users for your product:
1. What types of people or groups do you want to target? --- N/B: target behavioural patterns and motivations than age range.
2. In what places or forums can you find these users? -- Gyms, Doctors/Nutritionists, Online forums, other groups, Shops
3. Aim to come up with 7 - 10 different ways to find users to interview.

Bonus: Can you find examples of people having / discussing this problem online?

# Interview technigues
Interview questions should be based on our assumptions.

#Interviewing users:
Ask open questions.
Avoid inserting biais in your questions
Less interviews, more conversations!
... tell me more about that...
... help me understand better
... what do you mean by...
... That's really interesting. Can you tell me how that relates to...

Finding your customer...!
Customers cannot predict the future...

Tell me about the last time...
Who else has this problem...
What tools do you use for...
How often do you...
How much time/money does this cost you...

Talk to people that are not family or friends!

Even if family & friends fall into your target user demographic.

User Interview Best Practices:
Interview in person
